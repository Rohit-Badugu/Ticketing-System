# Ticketing-System ðŸ“ˆ
Ticketing system is a dashboard tool for viewing your tickets in the Zendesk system. It uses Zendesk APIs to fetch the data and is built using Python Flask webframework.

## User Stories :dart:
The below user stories are implemented.

:white_check_mark: Display all the tickets for a user account in a list. <br />
:white_check_mark: User can navigate into individual ticket details. <br />
:white_check_mark: Paging through tickets when more than 25 are returned. <br />
:white_check_mark: Error pages are added to handle a scenario where Zendesk APIs are unavailable or if there is a program error. <br />

```

### Usage
#### Configuration
In `config.py` on line 6, enter the Base64 encoded API KEY value

#### Running the server
